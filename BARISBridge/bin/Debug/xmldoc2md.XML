            The ICanBreak interface is used by ModuleQualityControl to determine which part modules in the configuration support breakable part modules.
            All the ModuleBreakableXXX part modules in BARIS implement this interface.

            Asks the implementer if the module is activated. Only activated modules will be considered during quality checks.
            The return value varies with the type of breakable part module; fuel tanks are always active, while converters,
            drills, and engines are only active when they are running.

            ModuleBreakableAsteroidDrill is designed to replace ModuleAsteroidDrill and interface ModuleQualityControl. When a part is declared broken, it disables the drill, and when the part is declared fixed,
            it re-enables it again. Almost all of the functionality is internal; all the part config designer needs to do is make sure that ModuleBreakableAsteroidDrill appears before ModuleQualityControl.
            In addition to the MTBF checks done over time, a quality check occurs whenever the drill is started or stopped. It is part of the BARISBridge plugin.
